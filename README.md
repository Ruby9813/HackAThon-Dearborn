# HackAThon-Dearborn
Hackathon Dearborn Project: Tic Tac Toe

Hello There-
What your seeing now is a mini console game you can play called Tic Tac Toe.
You've heard of it-

You take the code and dump it into your compiler in order to play. You can do it on any complier you see fit
But VSC is just a better option...^^

It switches between two players on the same device. 
One is X the other is O.
The rows are from 0 - 2. Top most row as zero the bottom as two. Ofcourse one is in the middle.
Same for the columns except it's from left to right. 
The left most one is zero the right most one is two. And one is in the middle. 

Here a little diagram to help you. (^^

If you see the raw version of the readme it will help you more. Since the diagram isn't properly demonstrating the board.
